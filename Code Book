#Codebook for run_analysis.R
##About this project
This code was designed for a course project, available through Coursera.

##Using this code
The source data was Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A description of the data is available from this site:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The raw data can be downloaded here:

##About the code
The code performs the following 5 steps, in accordance with instructions:
1. It merges the training and test sets into a single set.
2. Extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Names the activities with descriptive names.
4. " (Instructions 3 and 4 were almost redundant)
5. Creates a tidy, independent data set with the requested variables, and writes it into a text file.

##About the variables
x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the raw data.
x_data, y_data and subject_data are merges of the raw data.
features contains the names for the x_data dataset. These are applied to the stored column names.
